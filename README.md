This repo includes the solution I propose for Eric Wastl's Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/

Before using, make sure to install the required libraries.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I've added my own dataset in the `data` folder. Feel free to use your
own inputs.

You can run each day's challenge by simply using:

```shell
python y2020/day1.py
```
