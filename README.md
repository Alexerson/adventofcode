This repo includes the solution I propose for Eric Wastl's Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/

Before using, make sure to install the required libraries.

Iâ€™m trying the language latest features when I can and think about it.

As of 2024, the easiest way to run this is uv.

```shell
uv run src/y20YY/dayX.py
```

I've added my own dataset in the `data` folder. Feel free to use your
own inputs.
